# üéØ ChefORG Comprehensive Issues Analysis & Fix Recommendations

Based on detailed Lighthouse analysis, here are the identified issues and their priority fixes:

## üìä Performance Issues (Priority: HIGH)

### Eliminate render-blocking resources (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Resources are blocking the first paint of your page. Consider delivering critical JS/CSS inline and deferring all non-critical JS/styles. [Learn how to eliminate render-blocking resources](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/render-blocking-resources/).
**Impact:** Est savings of 150¬†ms
**Fix Priority:** üö® Critical

### Reduce unused JavaScript (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Reduce unused JavaScript and defer loading scripts until they are required to decrease bytes consumed by network activity. [Learn how to reduce unused JavaScript](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/unused-javascript/).
**Impact:** Est savings of 572¬†KiB
**Fix Priority:** üö® Critical

### Enable text compression (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Text-based resources should be served with compression (gzip, deflate or brotli) to minimize total network bytes. [Learn more about text compression](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-text-compression/).
**Impact:** Est savings of 2,213¬†KiB
**Fix Priority:** üö® Critical

### Render blocking requests (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Requests are blocking the page's initial render, which may delay LCP. [Deferring or inlining](https://web.dev/learn/performance/understanding-the-critical-path#render-blocking_resources) can move these network requests out of the critical path.
**Impact:** Est savings of 150¬†ms
**Fix Priority:** üö® Critical


## ‚ôø Accessibility Issues (Priority: HIGH)

### Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio. (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Low-contrast text is difficult or impossible for many users to read. [Learn how to provide sufficient color contrast](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/color-contrast).
**Impact:** Affects users with disabilities
**Fix Priority:** üö® Critical

### Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Properly ordered headings that do not skip levels convey the semantic structure of the page, making it easier to navigate and understand when using assistive technologies. [Learn more about heading order](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.10/heading-order).
**Impact:** Affects users with disabilities
**Fix Priority:** üö® Critical


## üõ°Ô∏è Best Practices Issues (Priority: MEDIUM)

### Browser errors were logged to the console (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Errors logged to the console indicate unresolved problems. They can come from network request failures and other browser concerns. [Learn more about this errors in console diagnostic audit](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/best-practices/errors-in-console/)
**Fix Priority:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium


## üîç SEO Issues (Priority: MEDIUM)

### Document does not have a meta description (Score: 0/100)
**Issue:** Meta descriptions may be included in search results to concisely summarize page content. [Learn more about the meta description](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/seo/meta-description/).
**Fix Priority:** üìù Medium
